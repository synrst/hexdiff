DESCRIPTION

This program reads data from one or more files and finds bytes or
groups of bytes which are different. The differences are displayed in
both hexadecimal and ASCII and highlighted for easy comparison.

CHANGES

0.01 - 2018-04-01
	- Initial release

0.02 - 2018-04-18
	- Added -I option to ignore differences
	- Added llq_num.c and llq_num.h in support of ignore

0.03 - 2018-07-05
	- Fixed issue with starting position past a smaller shift
	- Fixed issue reading from STDIN

0.04 - 2018-10-02
	- Fixed infinite loop reading from STDIN with offset past EOF
	- Adjusted bytes read from STDIN due to inability to seek
	- Handle 0 position edge cases to prevent infinite loops

0.05 - 2018-10-26
	- Fixed calculating differences based on word size with -h
	- Highlighting performed along with difference calculations
	- Limited highlighting width to maximum byte size (size_t)
	- Added version number and release date to usage

0.06 - 2018-10-26
	- Fixed difference count used to determine if a line is printed

0.07 - 2018-11-17
	- Fixed comparing NULL bytes with zero as different

0.08 - 2018-12-07
	- Added the -u option to display uppercase hexadecimal values

0.09 - 2018-12-14
	- Fixed comparing NULL bytes to NULL bytes as different
	- Fixed displaying an empty line of all NULLs at EOF

0.10 - 2019-02-06
	- Prevent reading in a directory as a file

0.11 - 2019-03-07
	- Improved difference comparison, especially for NULL bytes
	- Allow ignoring a difference of zero with -I, which can be
	  be relevant with using -N to compare NULL bytes with zeroes

0.12 - 2019-07-06
	- Further improved difference comparison
	- NULL bytes are not different if both are NULL
	- Added ifdef on assert for compiling on older systems

0.13 - 2020-02-10
	- Fixed potential bit shift overflow in print_empty_pos()
